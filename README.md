# Introduction
Even if you have never dined in a Michelin-starred restaurant, you still know it is a pretty big deal. Since the early 20th century, the Michelin Dining Guide has seemed to be a conclusive sign of quality, services, dining experience and world-class food. Nothing, however, is only shiny and sparkling—there are a lot of controversies that revolved around the Michelin star award…Some critics pointed out that the Michelin judges were biased towards French cuisine and some locals in Hong Kong had regarded the Michelin star rating as erratic and peculiar. 

So, you may wonder, are these true?

# Methodologies
In the voice of doubt, part 1 endeavors to scrap the data from a total number of 3,135 Michelin-starred restaurants around the globe, including their restaurant name (h3 class="card__menu-content--title last pl-text pl-big"), distinction level (i class="fa-michelin"), location (div class="card__menu-footer--location flex-fill pl-text") and cuisine type (div class="card__menu-footer--price pl-text") in order to allow you re-understanding whether the Michelin Guide is “biased” from the perspective of an objective data, then further study the situation in China (mainland, Hong Kong & Macau).

Meanwhile, part 2 scrapped the data from Openrice (a local public food review website) and Michelin Guide HK 2021. The data covers the upper & lower menu price, geocoded address and keywords mined from restaurant description text, this part compares these components from the restaurant of the 2 sets to analyze the difference between the "elite’s taste" and the "public’s taste".
