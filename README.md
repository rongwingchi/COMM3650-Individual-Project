# Introduction
Even if you've never gone out of your way to eat at a Michelin-starred restaurant, you still know it's a pretty big deal. Since the early 20th century, it's been a definitive sign of quality, dining experience, and world-class food. Nothing, however, is only shiny and sparkly. There's a lot of controversies that swirls around the entire idea of a Michelin star--some critics pointed out that the Michelin judges were biased towards French cuisine, so you may wonder, is that true?

In the voice of doubt, part one endeavors to scrap the data from a total number of 3,135 Michelin-starred restaurants around the globe, including their restaurant name (h3 class="card__menu-content--title last pl-text pl-big"), distinction level (i class="fa-michelin"), location (div class="card__menu-footer--location flex-fill pl-text") and cuisine type (div class="card__menu-footer--price pl-text") in order to allow you re-understanding whether the Michelin Guide is “biased” from the perspective of an objective data, then further study the situation in China (mainland, Hong Kong & Macau).
